# Eurotherm_GUI
# Coded by JJ Gregory, 8/5/2022

Hello,
This file is the Eurotherm interactive GUI that contains 8 graphs, 4 of which are set up so that you can enable customizable axes / graph generation.
Unfortunately, this program is slightly unfinished. However, I have attached a few to-do's for you so that you can finish coding what I was unable to get around to.
It should not be too complex; you can do it!

This program uses three timers in its background: two that update every second, and one that updates every 1/10 seconds.
Be sure your computer can handle the complexity of this program!

Signing off,
JJ :)
